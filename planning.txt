if moving to an actual backend with routes:
dont print anything in the db functions. just throw a db error and handle the appropriate printing in the routes
^consider an enum that holds OK or ERROR and act accordingly in the routes (i miss rust pattern matching)

tkinter imp

next: have functions return the items.

consider having a specified return type for get and search. Read returns an Item. the others don't.
(it will need to be an array or list or vector of some sort)

implement tests under /tests.py?
