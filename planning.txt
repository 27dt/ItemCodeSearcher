if moving to an actual backend with routes:
dont print anything in the db functions. just throw a db error and handle the appropriate printing in the routes
^consider an enum that holds OK or ERROR and act accordingly in the routes (i miss rust pattern matching)

next: have functions return the items.

consider having a specified return type for get and search. Read returns an Item. the others don't.
(it will need to be an array or list or vector of some sort)

implement tests under /tests.py?


set up again with classes. add set types.

fix the names. what i mean by this is that we have delete_item in db and then delete_item in main. fix that.

error checking on tkinter UI functions. wrap in a try block and if an exception is caught, display a text label 
i.e. if someone tries to add an item and leaves the fields blank, either:
1. display an error message
2. display either an 'invalid fields' or ' duplicate item' 
3. return the db error message

^ CONSIDER MAKING THE ERROR MESSAGES, AND USE A RETURN OF AN ARRAY WITH A RETURN AND AN ERROR THING. RUUST PATTERN MATCHING.






DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
TAB:
    ITEMS
    - LIST BOX OF ALL ITEMS IN CURRENT DATABASE.
        - TAKEN FROM GET_ALL_ITEMS IN DB, SIMILAR TO HOW IT IS ALREADY IMPLEMENTED
    - REFRESH BUTTON:
        - CALLS GET_ALL_ITEMS AND UPDATES DB, TO SHOW ANY CHANGES (MIGHT NOT BE NEEDED, AS DELETE/ADD/UPDATE WILL DO AUTOMATICALLY)
    - DELETE BUTTON (INITIALLY GREYED OUT)
        - BECOMES AN OPTION IF AN ITEM IS SELECTED IN A LIST
        - IF AN ITEM IS SELECTED, ITS INFO IS POPULATED IN GREYED OUT ADD BOXES BELOW
        - IN THE EVENT THIS BREAKS, DISPLAY DB ERROR FUNCTION FOR DELETE_ITEM IN STATUS BAR BELOW
    
    
    HAVE TO DETERMINE WHEN THESE ITEMS BECOME AVAILABLE. LIKE WHEN EACH IS GREYED OUT AND SUCH
    - UPDATE BUTTON (INITIALLY GREYED OUT)
        - BECOMES AN OPTION IF AN ITEM IS SELECTED IN A LIST
        - ITEM FIELDS BECOME UNLOCKED 
    - ADD BUTTON


TAB: SEARCH/LOOKUP
    - BUTTON SEARCH OR LOOKUP
    - IF SEARCH: DISPLAY SEARCH BAR (CLEAR FIELD OPTION), SEARCH BUTTON. ON SEARCH CLICK, LIST BOX BELOW IS POPULATED WITH MATCHING OPTIONS 
                 FROM THE SEARCH ITEMS DB FUNCTION. SHOULD RETURN AN ARRAY OF ITEMS SIMILAR TO GET ALL ITEMS, AND POPULATE THE LIST BOX. IF NOT THERE, 
                 THERE SHOULD BE A STATUS MESSGAGE BELOW WHICH DISPLAYS THAT DB ERROR FUNCTION WHICH IS RETURNED.
    - IF LOOKUP: DISPLAY ITEM ID BAR (CLEAR FIELD OPTION), LOOKUP BUTTON. ON LOOKUP CLICK, LIST BOX BELOW IS POPULATED WITH MATCHING ITEM
                 FROM THE GET ITEM DB FUNCTION, WHICH SHOULD RETURN AN ITEM, AND POPULATES THE LIST BOX. IF NOT THERE, THERE SHOULD BE A STATUS 
                 MESSAGE BELOW WHICH DISPLAYS THAT DB ERROR FUNCTION WHICH IS RETURNED
